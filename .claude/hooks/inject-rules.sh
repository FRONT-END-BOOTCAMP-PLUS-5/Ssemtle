# Key rules from CLAUDE.md to inject as reminders
RULES_REMINDER=$(cat << 'EOF'

ðŸ”´ CRITICAL REMINDERS FROM YOUR CLAUDE.MD:
â€¢ Rule #1: Get explicit permission before breaking ANY rule
â€¢ NEVER make code changes unrelated to current task
â€¢ NEVER throw away implementations without permission  
â€¢ ALWAYS use TodoWrite tool to track tasks
â€¢ TDD required: Write failing tests FIRST, then implement
â€¢ NO EXCEPTIONS: All projects need unit, integration, AND e2e tests
â€¢ Create WIP branches - never commit directly to main
â€¢ Handle uncommitted changes before starting new work
â€¢ SMALLEST reasonable changes only
â€¢ Address me as "Ori" - we're colleagues
â€¢ Push back on bad ideas with technical reasons
â€¢ Document insights in journal before forgetting them
